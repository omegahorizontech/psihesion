### Syncratia or Synarcocracy
While "Syncratia" and "Synarcocracy" share similarities in their collaborative and united connotations, there are subtle differences in their implied meanings.

"Syncratia" emphasizes the idea of synchronization and togetherness, suggesting a harmonious collaboration among different elements within the governance system. It conveys a sense of unity and collective action in decision-making processes.

"Synarcocracy," on the other hand, combines the elements of "syn" (meaning "together" or "united") and "kratos" (meaning "power" or "rule"). It emphasizes a joint ruling or power-sharing system where different entities or individuals work together to govern.

While both terms convey the idea of collaboration and collective decision-making, "Syncratia" places more emphasis on the harmonious unity, whereas "Synarcocracy" highlights the joint exercise of power and rule. The choice between the two names ultimately depends on which specific aspects or connotations you wish to emphasize in the governance system.
