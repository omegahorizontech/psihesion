# Psihesion Role Detail
Roles available to each faction. Many of the roles are large encompassing categories and often overlap when applied to a single individual who may have additional roles. Indiviudals seem to be specialized, although in fact an individual often in multi-specialized. Therefore, one should better orient their mental model around that of a network (as opposed to a tree) when thinking about how one a role fits for an infividual with multiple roles (or classes).

In the context of Psihesion, the roles are a simplifications of the variety of skills that associate with any given subfield or role. In total, there are 30 roles, 12 of which are not for any affinity in particular. Each affinity specializes around three primary roles.

### Artist
###### Purpose
Artists copy, transform, and combine media to create what generally is called art.

###### Description
Artist is an inclusive term encompassing artisan classes. In addition, it points to other roles besides the visual arts. Actors, writers, musicians, chefs, photographers, entertainers (comedians - celebrities), and many other subfields of what we know as art fields fit under the artist umbrella term.

Other professions like the entertainer additionally might fit into other roles. A few examples contemporary to the 21st century are the YouTuber, Journalist, and Twitter Celebrity. A person who studies/practices with media and communications technologies generally fits into multiple large parent roles.

### Philosopher
###### Purpose
Philosophers ask questions with the goal of better understanding the Universe/Cosmos. Some questions have no answers.

###### Description
Many different kinds of philosophy exist. Generally speaking, philosophy dialectics tends to vary based on topic which leads to divisions or groups within the field. Groupings of philosophical schools assist in the exchange of ideas between philosophers.

For example, philosophers interested in metaphysics and epistemology may not necessarily interact with those focused on science, logic and mathematics. What follows is a complexity where people with differing views and perspectives probably only share in the mutual journey to better understand existence.

### Magistrate
###### Purpose
Power is ceded to the class of people who implement, govern, and in some cases make the rules of society. Magistrates tend to take on these roles within society if unchallenged.

###### Description
Magistrates take on many different forms including politicians, diplomats, ambassadors, bureaucrats, spies, business magnates, lawyers, judges, clerks and other officials. Partnering with or becoming propagandists and public relations experts is common in societies with complex media.

As technologies evolve, older mediums become less effective and control mechanisms erode. With the rise of AI, magistrates tend to lose political and economic power. Common counters are to relegate other roles to support functions. Clever magistrates often see the benefits in ceding power to other classes and that those improvements outweigh the costs of maintaining rigid institutional arrangements.

### Materials Engineer
###### Purpose
Materials Engineers manipulate materials with wisdom of the physical characteristics of matter, and they often use their expertise to assist others.

###### Description
Generally, materials are made of these three seemingly discrete categories: metals, ceramics, and plastics. But in fact, we often study matter from multiple vantage points. One is the structure of matter at different scales, and another is atomic bonding. Materials engineers rely on a holistic knowledge built from other fields like chemistry and physics.

New materials dramatically widen the set of options our species has at its fingertips. Good materials make transiting from a planet's surface to space possible, but better materials make transit efficient. For example, one required material property for a theoretical space elevator's tether is very high tensile strength to density ratio. These lightweight and strong materials are not found in nature and most industrial materials are not suitable for viable space elevator transit.

### Physicist
###### Purpose
The physical Universe/Cosmos contains all matter, energy, and space. Physicists attempt to comprehend the magnitude of all spacetime through understanding the physical contents and interactions contained by the Universe.

###### Description
Systems of the Universe, sometimes called the Cosmos, are often represented via mathematics and symbols. Physicists fundamentally observe and measure complex systems of the Universe. Those observations and measurements are transcribed into mathematical relationships. When rigorous and high degrees of certainty about phenomena are reached, physicists organize their observations and measurements into well-substantiated explanations (also known as scientific theories).

Scientific theories allow people to predict physical phenomena such as thermodynamics, kinematics, and relativity. In other words, physicists improve our collective knowledge of ideas like motion, forces, the conservation of energy and momentum, electricity, magnetism, heat, waves, and gravity.

### Industrial Engineer
###### Purpose
Factories, supply lines, machines, and people harmonize due to the deliberate intervention of someone acting as an industrial engineer.

###### Description
Orchestras have conductors, teams have coaches, and the production processes of our economy have industrial engineers. In each case, the result is often more than the sum of its parts. Logistics and supply chains comprise complex arrangements of systems and people. Industrial engineers develop techniques to optimize systems in order to enhance the flow of labor and automation in our species.

Industrial engineers analyze factors including raw material acquisition, manufacturing processes, production deliveries, and research initiatives. Their use of applied systems theory improves the goods and services we use and exchange with each other.

## -Psionic-
### Oracle
###### Purpose
Oracles use electromagnetism, less understood physics, and other forms of mysticism to shape society at the level of culture.

###### Description
The abilities of oracles throughout history are inscribed in legend, myth, and other fantastic stories. Occasionally regarded as mages in passing, they control the physical world in unprecedented and poorly understood ways. Yet, many imposters use alluring mysticism to benefit from the credulity of na√Øve bystanders.

Prophecy centered oracles rely heavily on telepathic information and are empaths or technopaths in different contexts. Mystics think they convene with invisible forces or gods. Abilities like precognition, clairvoyance, and psychometry shape how oracles view and order spacetime. Seemingly invalidating physics, master oracles manipulate matter and energy as healers or disrupters of natural and artificial systems and networks.

### Cultural Scientist
###### Purpose
Cultural scientists understand, observe, and measure emotional threads and paradigms as those strands mesh together into societal behaviors, beliefs, rituals, and other cultural states.

###### Description
Many titles stick with cultural scientists due to the breadth of their craft. Propagandists, public relation specialists, and other media experts gather measurements and metrics in reproducible ways to replicate culture. Other cultural scientists focus on specific cultural interactions in their capacity as anthropologists, sociologists, economists, and psychologists (among other titles). All cultural scientists rely on their knowledge of the related subject matter of the arts, humanities, linguistics, computation, and statistics.

Prominent sociocultural techniques parallel the kinds which develop from any scientific revolution. Like the outgrowth of chemists from alchemy, a shared appreciation of the scientific method led cultural scientists out of their version of pseudoscience. Computerized and automated techniques assist in simulating, forecasting, and automating cultural goals.

### Advisor
###### Purpose
Advisors provide key insights to various cultural decision makers and their advice shifts outcomes potentially altering the course of society.

###### Description
Serving as communicative links between different roles, advisors provide unique perspectives to other leaders. Trusted advisors transfer and synthesize key information. When advisors develop trust with other leaders, that trust rewards them with leadership positions in their advisees cultural networks. Like chameleons, some advisors periodically assume the functions of other roles when required.

In public contexts, they represent the collective will of the leading socioeconomic culture and hold official roles. Magistrates trust advisors with matters including those of security, finance, religiosity, and governance. In more private capacities, Advisors are more intimate and assist with embarrassing or humiliating problems. Great advisors adeptly grow their networks of influence while they capture solutions to varying ailments.

## -Kubernetic-
### Cybernetician
###### Purpose
Cyberneticians automate, guide, and control the flow of information while they steer the development of synthetic, organic, machine, and animal systems.

###### Description
The history of cyberneticians is originally rooted in a variety of mathematical theories including information theory, control theory, and systems theory. Additionally, early artificial intelligence, decision making methods, and organizational management practices stem from early cybernetics. Contemporary cyberneticians interact with mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive, and sociocultural systems.

Scientists, designers, theorists, educators, innovators, and leaders all rely on cyberneticians due to their knowledge of governance and control. Cyberneticians apply general principles and transdisciplinary methods to improve the efficiency of systems in society.

### Hacker
###### Purpose
Allegedly originating as one who makes furniture with an axe, the modern hacker metaphorically axes the works, systems, and innovations of others in order to combine them into new and novel concepts.

###### Description
Ethical constraints, or the lack thereof, guide hackers as they bypass the limits of systems. Due to their ability to navigate around political, ethical, and safety considerations, the cultural space of hackers is somewhat mystical.

No longer confined to just computerized systems, they interface with biological, chemical, physical, and societal systems to disrupt or heal networks. Hackers act from a place of convoluted authority and motive. Ultimately, expert hackers cut problems into manageable pieces and combine those shreds into entirely different and novel solutions. Often, hacked systems have unintended side effects for both their original and new userbase.

### Logician
###### Purpose
Logicians find truth in the Universe/Cosmos with inferences and reasoning which are based on a set of initial true premises.

###### Description
Logicians rely on a multitude of properties which include consistency, validity, completeness, soundness, and expressivity. Some formal systems, like first-order predicate logic, have all these properties. Other formal systems do not. For example, sufficiently expressive systems tend to be mathematically incomplete and inconsistent.

Historically, logicians provide formal structure and guidance to cybernetic systems. Their abilities and contributions are not always happily received, though, due to sociocultural circumstance. Logic leads societies to enlightened views when tentatively accepted often to the dismay of tyrants and authoritarian hegemonies.

## -Biotic-
### Biologist
###### Purpose
Organic systems emerge from networks of life and biologists forge and discover the keys of those networks.

###### Description
Biologists understand life via the lens of structure, physiology, evolution, and systems theory. Microbiology, botany, and zoology are encompassing categories of biology and include many subfields. Insightful biologists identify relationships between biological systems by comparing their properties.

Growth and control are paramount to biological studies and provide understandings of society's members. Therefore, ethics is forefront due to the literal life-altering effects on society. Biologists wield the keys to improving medicines, therapies, and other life-changing techniques. Historically, biologists support programs with many gray areas such as eugenics programs, stem cell research, and other biomedical research endeavors.

### Geneticist
###### Purpose
Due to their privilege as champions of biological instruction sets, geneticists guide the organic destiny of life.

###### Description
In organic life, a genome consists of the entire sequence of nucleotides for an organism. Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) refers to subsets of sequenced nucleotides. Nucleotides are organic molecules, and there are five types in Earth-based life. Four are found in DNA (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine) and uracil replaces thymine in RNA (which is a similar genetic structure).

Genes refer to DNA subsets that contain instructions for making a single protein. Proteins build the larger pieces of living organisms, like enzymes, antibodies, and body tissues. Geneticists alter genetic components, and cascade the changes upwards through the building blocks of life. For example, genetic components like codons molecularly bond with the cellular machinery responsible for arranging amino acids into proteins. Ethical geneticists deliberately mutate genomes to produce proteins and life with augmented forms and marvelous function.

### Ecologist
###### Purpose
Ecologists weave systems of positive reinforcing cycles together in order to create eternally blooming life.

###### Description
Ecosystems refer to the notion of dynamic sets of interactions between biotic and abiotic components. Biotic factors differ based on food source, or biological energy supply, and are distinguished as producers (autotrophs), consumers (heterotrophs), and decomposers (detritivores) - a special kind of consumer which makes use of dead biological matter. Abiotic factors, including chemical and physical interactions, impact the growth, maintenance, and reproduction of organisms.

Ecologists observe and understand ecosystems and are historically interested in concepts like biodiversity, cooperation and competition, biomass, and common-pool resources. Forward thinking ecologists take active measures in the successional (not to be confused with successful) development of ecosystems. The most skilled in their field generate abundance and distribute life-generating resources elegantly throughout ecological systems.

## -Genic-
### Leviathan
###### Purpose
As superorganisms with transformative motives, often with world-shaping consequences,
Leviathans emerge at the interaction between smaller systems of intelligence.

###### Description
Mythos depicts Leviathans as sea-dwellers living in the darkest and unreachable  depths of the unknown. Their namesake as sovereigns commands veneration and awe. Cultural norms and contracts with long-lasting impact shape their surrounding. The intimidating mystery of their being enthralls both their allies and their constituency. The living Leviathan resembles a tiptoeing giant who through accident causes earthquakes for the ants that live among them.

Leviathans aim to grow themselves and their society as they interact and thrive. As the ones who takes many forms, Leviathans coordinate the goals of their Administrators and Drones. Leviathans access techniques ranging across those possessed from its members. The complexity in the relationship between the Leviathan's components sing louder than their collective voice. A Leviathan as a single entity resembles that of an entire faction whose song echoes through time. Networked organic and/or synthetic intelligences often combine their qualia to form a single unique Leviathan with perplexing goals.  

### Administrator
###### Purpose
Those who maintain, manage, and supervise the labor in our society call themselves Administrators, and the context of their work permeates the day-to-day actions of our people.

###### Description
Modern Administrators shed the jaded and dark aspects of their role's roots as Overseers and Supervisors. Administrators reinvented their primary activities, but the shadow of their supervisory and managerial capacity continues to haunt them. The ideal aspect of administration occurs with seemingly self-dictating systems - in these scenarios Administrators simply observe and recognize the accomplishments of their Drone workforce.

In the best of scenarios, Administrators serve the public interest through their capacity to network other specialties together. As they attend to different systems, they find themselves administrating databases, forums, networks, governments, hospitals, and other organizational and societal institutions. The most skilled Administrators find themselves merging and enhancing their capabilities in unique ways as they often become or merge into a Leviathan.

### Drone
###### Purpose
Drones carry out basic services and tasks, with some of the earliest historical references dating to mass production and the assembly lines of the industrial era.

###### Description
Labor unions embodied the voice of the Drone. Presently, modern Drone networks communicate and organize through networked infrastructure. In the past, collective action movements forced powerful classes to provide rights to the Drone workforce. Now instead, the labor of Drones resounds and booms so much so that the bargaining process short circuits before it starts - Drones earn respect implicitly.

Drones continually reinvent themselves due to their desire for general self-improvement. Historical drones, in contrast, more closely resembled the aimless pheromone following of insect worker drones. Today, their motivation to complete tasks efficiently supersedes any other goal, and each completed task fundamentally improves their ability to do work.
