> "Copyleft is a strategy of utilizing copyright law and licensing to pursue the policy goal of fostering and encouraging the equal and inalienable right to copy, share, modify and improve creative works of authorship. Copyleft (as a general term) describes any method that utilizes the copyright system (in whole or in part) to achieve the aforementioned goal. Copyleft as a concept is usually implemented in the details of a specific license, such as the General Public License (GPL) and copyleft-next. Authors of creative works can unilaterally choose these licenses for their own works to build communities that collaboratively share and improve those copylefted creative works. Copyleft licenses require that downstream recipients of the creative works receive the means and methods to usefully modify and improve those works of authorship. For software copyleft licenses, users receive the “complete, corresponding source” code for the software — allowing those users to conveniently modify and reinstall that software."
